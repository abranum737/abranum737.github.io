<p>Explore a diverse collection of digital artwork created using Adobe Illustrator, demonstrating a range of techniques and styles in vector graphics:</p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/Room_mockup.jpg" title="Accent Wall" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="75%" %}
    </div>
</div>

<p>This image showcases three mockups of a nature-themed accent wall, blending contemporary aesthetics with forest and mountain motifs.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Concept:</strong> Evolution of a mountain-inspired accent wall design, demonstrating variations from naturalistic to minimalist styling.</li>
  <li><strong>Key Elements:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Left image: Simplified mountain scene in shades of green</li>
        <li>Top right: Enhanced version with wooden slat pattern and LED sun</li>
        <li>Bottom right: Minimalist interpretation with a reduced color palette</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>These mockups illustrate how subtle changes in texture, lighting, and color complexity can dramatically alter the mood and style of an accent wall, catering to different interior design preferences.</p>

<p>This figure illustrates the complex interplay between DNA damage response (DDR) and anti-tumor immunity in HR-deficient triple-negative breast cancer.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Concept:</strong> Demonstrating how DNA damage and its repair mechanisms influence tumor progression and immune surveillance.</li>
  <li><strong>Key Elements:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>DNA damage effects on tumor progression and immune recognition</li>
        <li>Role of DDR inhibitors in enhancing anti-tumor immunity</li>
        <li>Interaction between DDR pathways and immune checkpoint mechanisms</li>
        <li>Potential synergy of DDR inhibitors with immune checkpoint inhibitors</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This project showcases a custom logo created for a local aquaponics business, blending functional elements with artistic design:</p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/Adobe trial 8.png" title="Aquaponics" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Concept:</strong> A visual representation of the aquaponics ecosystem, integrating pipes, plants, and fish.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Key Elements:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Stylized PVC pipes, symbolizing the system's infrastructure</li>
      <li>Leafy plant sprouts, representing the grown produce</li>
      <li>Jumping fish silhouettes, illustrating the aquaculture component</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This logo effectively communicates the interconnected nature of aquaponics, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers while maintaining a professional business image.</p>
