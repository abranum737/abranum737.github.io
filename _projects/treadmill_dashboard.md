<h2>Treadmill Marketing Dashboard</h2>

<p>This PowerBI dashboard offers insights into demographic information across three types of treadmills at different price points to guide marketing strategies.</p>

<h3>How to Use:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Select one of the following dashboards: <strong>Customer Profile Dashboard</strong>, <strong>Contingency Table Dashboard</strong>, or <strong>Correlation-Pvalues Dashboard</strong>.</li>

  <li>In the <strong>Customer Profile Dashboard</strong>, use the slicers to filter data by demographic variables, including age, education, self-rated fitness level, gender, income, marital status, miles per week, and usage per week.</li>

  <li>Hover over the bars in the demographic charts to reveal income breakdowns for each treadmill type.</li>

  <li>Click on the columns representing different demographics (e.g., treadmill type) to further explore how variables like fitness level, income, education, and miles per week correlate with age and treadmill type.</li>

  <li>In the <strong>Contingency Table Dashboard</strong>, apply slicers to view marginal probabilities for different demographic groups across treadmill types or use them to view specific demographic subgroups.</li>

  <li>Analyze conditional probabilities by reviewing contingency tables showing Pr(Treadmill Purchase | Demographic) and Pr(Demographic | Treadmill Purchase), offering insights into purchasing trends across demographics.</li>

  <li>The <strong>Correlation-Pvalues Dashboard</strong> displays a heatmap that visualizes correlations between demographics and treadmill types. P-values are also provided to assess statistical significance across demographic groups.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Key Features:</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Demographic Filtering:</strong> Easily filter data by customer demographics such as age, income, education, fitness level, and usage patterns to get targeted insights.</li>

  <li><strong>Education and Income:</strong> A higher number of customers with graduate degrees opted for the KP781 treadmill, with the majority falling in the $50K-$79K income bracket.</li>
  <li><strong>Conditional Probabilities:</strong> Customers in the $50K-$79K income range have a 41% probability of purchasing the KP481 treadmill. For KP781, those earning between $80K-$105K constitute 34% of the purchasers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Statistical Insights:</h3>

<p><strong>Correlations:</strong> No strong correlations were found between variables like income and treadmill type, with the highest correlation being a 0.06 positive association between income and miles.</p>
<p><strong>P-Values:</strong> Significant differences were found in income across treadmill types, with weak associations for education and gender.</p>

<p>This interactive tool is designed to provide valuable insights for marketers, managers, and analysts, offering a dynamic way to explore and understand customer behavior and treadmill performance over time.</p>
