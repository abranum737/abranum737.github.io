Hello! I’m Anne Branum-Jiao, a data engineer with a passion for solving data issues and designing beautiful dashboards. I have experience with PowerBI, Tableu, Excel, SQL, DBT, and Snowflake. I have worked in different fields such as consumer marketing and biomedical research and I use intuition and data exploration techniques that come from years of experience to help me find data-driven insights. With a background in physics and a growing expertise in data science, I strive to make meaningful contributions in whatever I do.

In my spare time, I enjoy contributing to scientific discussions and learning new data analysis methods. You can often find me browsing Medium articles and PubMed for the latest in scientific research and tech trends. I have two tonkinese kitties and love watching trashy reality tv shows.

My publications can be found on the [publications page]({{ '/publications/' | relative_url }}), and current projects are in the [projects page]({{ '/projects/' | relative_url }}).
