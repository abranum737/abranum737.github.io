Hello! I’m Anne Branum-Jiao, a biomedical researcher with a passion for advancing health outcomes through innovative research and data-driven insights. With a background in physics and a growing expertise in data science, I specialize in developing novel techniques to analyze and visualize complex biological data. I’m currently focused on projects that explore immune resilience and its impact on disease resistance.

In my spare time, I enjoy contributing to scientific discussions and learning new data analysis methods. You can often find me browsing Medium articles and PubMed for the latest in scientific research and tech trends.

My publications can be found on the [publications page](/al-folio/publications/), and current projects are in the [projects page](/al-folio/projects/).
